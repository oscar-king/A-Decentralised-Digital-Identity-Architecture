# A Decentralised Digital Identity Architecture

This is a toy implementation of the architecture proposed by Geoff Goodell and Tomaso Aste in [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08769) paper.

## Download

Use [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) to clone the project.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HarryThomas17/A-Decentralised-Digital-Identity-Architecture.git
```

## Setup
The project makes use of Docker, Docker Compose, and Hyperledger Composer, so if you do not already have them you can install them here:
1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/installation/)
2. [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/compose/install/#install-compose)
3. [Install Hyperledger Composer CLI](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/v0.19/installing/development-tools.html) (remove @19 from npm commands)

## Building Dependencies
The project makes use of a base image with all dependencies installed on it. This is done to save time in subsequent builds. This base image can be built manually:
1. Ensure you are in the project's root directory.
2. Run the following `docker build -t code_latest:latest .`
This builds the image from the dockerfile located in the project root. 

## Running
2 shell scripts are included to start and stop the project (bring up Hyperledger Fabric and Flask containers). To start the project, run `./start.sh`. To stop the project, run `./stop.sh`. After `start.sh` completes successfully, you can bring up and down the Flask containers only with `docker-compose down` and `docker-compose up --build -d`.

## Sockets
The default configuration for the project is to have docker compose deploy all the containers locally on `localhost/0.0.0.0`. Additionally the endpoints for the specific entities are as follows:

|           Entity        | Directory Name  |      Port     |
| ------------------------|:---------------:|:-------------:|
|           User          |        ap       |     5000      |
| Authentication Provider |        ap       |     5001      |
| Cerfication Provider    |        cp       |     5002      |
|          Service        |        ap       |     5003      |
|          Ledger         |      ledger     |     8080      |
